# Email Spam Classifier

## Overview

This project focuses on building an Email Spam Classifier to distinguish between spam and legitimate emails using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The primary goal of this project was to design and evaluate a robust model capable of accurately identifying spam emails based on textual content.

# Key Contributions

## Data Preprocessing
- Implemented techniques to clean and preprocess email text, including:
-- Tokenization, removal of stopwords, and stemming.
-- Handling missing values and transforming text data into numerical formats using methods like TF-IDF or Bag-of-Words.

# Model Development
- Explored multiple machine learning algorithms, such as:
--Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
- Tuned hyperparameters to optimize model performance.

# Evaluation and Results
- Evaluated models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Achieved [95% accuracy], demonstrating the effectiveness of the chosen approach.

# Visualization and Documentation
- Created clear visualizations to represent data distributions, model performance, and feature importance.
- Documented the entire process in a structured Jupyter Notebook for transparency and reproducibility.

# Challenges Solved
- Managed imbalanced datasets by applying techniques like oversampling or undersampling to improve model fairness.
- Addressed common text data challenges, such as noisy data and variable email structures.
- Designed a scalable and efficient pipeline for text preprocessing and classification.

# Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries and Tools**: Scikit-learn, NLTK, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

# Learning Outcomes
- This project provided hands-on experience in:
